Hello! Over here I try to create different projects, learn from the community and keep my creative side alive! I usually mix different skills, technologies, and arts into the projects I'm working on.

ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently learning how to write blog posts. If you want to check out how I'm doing, take a look at [serenpit](https://serenpit.com).

ðŸ˜„   Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡   Fun fact: I was confused with with The professor from Money Heist several times in Brazilian carnaval. (I didn't even know who that was at the time lol)

ðŸ“«  Wanna talk? ping me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiagoaugustosm/) to a quick chat.
