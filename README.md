My name is Thiago Augusto and over here I try to create different projects, learn and help the community to build awesome things!

ðŸŒ±   Iâ€™m currently learning how to write blog posts. If you want to check out how I'm doing, take a look at [serenpit](https://serenpit.com).

ðŸ˜„   Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡   Fun fact: I was confused with with The professor from Money Heist several times in Brazilian carnaval. (I didn't even know who that was at the time lol)

ðŸ“«  How to reach me: you can ping me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thiagoaugustosm/) to a quick chat.
